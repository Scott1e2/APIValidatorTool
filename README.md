# purpose and functions for the API Security Testing Tool

## Overview
This tool is designed to test API endpoints for security vulnerabilities, focusing on authentication, authorization, rate limiting, sensitive data exposure, and endpoint enumeration. It includes features for red team activities, security baseline tracking, and compliance mapping with OWASP API Top 10.

## Features
- **Authentication and Authorization Checks**: Validates access controls and authorization, including BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) issues.
- **Rate Limiting Analysis**: Identifies endpoints that lack rate limiting, which could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Detects sensitive data exposure in API responses.
- **Endpoint Enumeration**: Attempts to discover undocumented or hidden endpoints.
- **Red Team and Threat Tracking**: Simulates token manipulation, replay attacks, and privilege escalation.
- **Compliance Mapping**: Maps findings to OWASP API Top 10 standards for reporting purposes.
- **Baseline Tracking**: Tracks baseline reports over time to identify deviations or newly introduced risks.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/api-security-testing-tool.git
    cd api-security-testing-tool
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Settings**:
    - Open `config.json` to set API endpoints, authentication tokens, enable specific security checks, and set red team options.

## Usage
1. **Run API Security Scans**:
    ```bash
    python api_scanner.py
    ```
   - The script performs authentication checks, rate limiting analysis, sensitive data exposure tests, and endpoint enumeration.

2. **Generate Vulnerability Report**:
    ```bash
    python report_generator.py
    ```
   - Generates a report with risk scores, OWASP API Top 10 compliance mappings, and remediation guidance in `api_security_report.txt` (plaintext) and `api_security_report.json` (JSON).

## Configuration
- **config.json**: Stores configuration for API endpoints, authentication, security checks, red team options, and alert thresholds.
    - **api_endpoints**: List of API URLs for security testing.
    - **authentication**: Settings for token type, access token, and MFA.
    - **security_checks**: Enables specific checks, including rate limiting, sensitive data exposure, and BOLA.
    - **red_team_options**: Activates token manipulation, replay attacks, and privilege escalation simulations.
    - **baseline_tracking**: Enables baseline tracking and sets history limits for previous reports.

## Advanced Features
1. **Compliance Mapping with OWASP API Standards**:
   - Each vulnerability includes mappings to OWASP API Top 10 categories for compliance tracking.

2. **Prioritized Risk Scoring**:
   - Vulnerabilities are scored based on severity and exploitability, allowing for targeted remediation.

3. **Baseline Tracking and Historical Comparison**:
   - Tracks previous reports, allowing for historical comparisons to identify new or unresolved vulnerabilities.

## Example Configuration and Sample Output
- **config.json** (Example):
    ```json
    {
        "api_endpoints": ["https://api.example.com/v1/users"],
        "authentication": {
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "access_token": "your_access_token_here"
        },
        "security_checks": {
            "auth_validation": true,
            "rate_limiting_check": true,
            "sensitive_data_check": true
        }
    }
    ```

- **Sample Output (api_security_report.txt)**:
    ```
    API Security Report
    =====================
    Total Vulnerabilities: 3
    Total Risk Score: 22

    Description: Unauthorized access allowed on API endpoint.
    Severity: High
    Risk Score: 21
    OWASP Compliance: API1 - Broken Object Level Authorization
    Recommendation: Implement stricter authorization checks for sensitive resources.
